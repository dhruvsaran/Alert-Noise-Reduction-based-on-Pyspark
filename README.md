# Alert Analysis System with PySpark

The Alert Analysis System with PySpark is designed to efficiently process security alerts by leveraging Apache Spark's distributed processing capabilities. It analyzes alerts based on user behavior profiles, applying anomaly scoring to classify alerts as Normal, Suspicious, or Anomalous. The system integrates with PostgreSQL to retrieve user activity data and alerts, using configurable thresholds to detect security threats. With a focus on scalability and performance, it utilizes optimized Spark UDFs for data processing and caching, enabling efficient handling of large datasets. The solution provides flexibility through configurable sensitivity levels and output formats, supporting various data sources and formats for streamlined alert analysis.
